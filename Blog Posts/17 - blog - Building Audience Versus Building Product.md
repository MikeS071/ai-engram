# Building Audience Versus Building Product

Build an audience that wants what you're creating. Build products that prove why they should pay attention. Do both simultaneously or struggle with half the equation forever.

Build an audience without a product and you have attention with nothing to monetize. Build a product without an audience and you have value that no one knows exists.

Distribution without product is entertainment. Product without distribution is invisible.

## The Audience Trap

You have 50k followers. Your posts get engagement. People know your name.

But you can't convert them into customers for anything.

This is the audience trap. You've built attention without building something to direct it toward. Your audience is entertained, not invested. They'll like your content but won't pay for your product—because they're not sure what you actually do.

Many creators discover this the hard way. Massive audiences that produce minimal revenue. Engagement metrics that don't translate to business outcomes. Fame without fortune.

## The Product Trap

You built something valuable. It solves a real problem. Users love it.

But no one knows it exists, and you don't know how to reach them.

This is the product trap. You have value but no distribution. Every customer is a fight. Growth is expensive and slow. Meanwhile, inferior products with better distribution eat your market share.

Many builders discover this the hard way too. Great products that never find their audience. Technically superior solutions that lose to better-marketed competitors. Value without visibility.

## The Integrated Approach

The people who build sustainable businesses don't choose between audience and product. They build both simultaneously, each feeding the other.

Dan Koe grew 196k newsletter subscribers while creating courses and frameworks. The audience tells him what to build. The products give his audience something worth paying for.

Ben Thompson built Stratechery to 258k paid subscribers through consistent analysis. The analysis is both the content (audience) and the product (subscription). They're the same thing.

Packy McCormick turned Not Boring into both media company and investment platform. The audience enabled the business. The business justified the content.

## The Parallel System

Audience and product aren't sequential phases—they're parallel systems that fuel each other.

**Your audience tells you what to build.** Before you have an audience, you're guessing what people want. After you have an audience, they tell you. Comments, questions, responses—all are product feedback from people who might actually pay.

**Your product gives your audience something worth having.** Content without product is entertainment. Product proves that your content has substance—that you can actually do what you talk about.

**Building both simultaneously creates unfair advantages.** You learn faster because you're getting feedback from both directions. You grow faster because each side amplifies the other.

## The Build-In-Public Strategy

Here's how to make audience and product support each other:

**Document your building process.** The journey of creating your product is content for your audience. Every problem you solve, every decision you make, every lesson you learn—these are posts, threads, and articles.

**Use audience feedback to guide development.** Before building a feature, ask your audience. Let them tell you what they need. This isn't just market research—it's involvement that creates investment.

**Launch to your audience as you're building.** Don't wait for the perfect product. Launch early versions to your audience. They'll forgive imperfection because they've been part of the process.

**Create content that attracts ideal customers.** Not just any audience—the people who would actually pay for what you're building. Targeted content attracts targeted followers who become targeted customers.

## The Value Architecture

**Give away knowledge freely.** Your expertise, your insights, your frameworks. This builds audience. People follow you because you're valuable.

**Sell the productized implementation.** The knowledge is free. The done-for-you version costs money. The gap between knowing and having is where the product lives.

This isn't a contradiction. Free knowledge builds trust and distribution. Paid products convert that trust into sustainability.

---

## The Alternating Rhythm

If you're struggling to do both simultaneously, alternate focus:

**One month audience, one month product.** This creates dedicated time for each while maintaining progress on both.

**Use audience months to learn what to build.** Listen, engage, understand what your audience needs.

**Use product months to create what they've asked for.** Build, ship, collect feedback.

The alternation prevents getting stuck in either trap. You can't neglect audience forever when it's coming up next month. You can't neglect product forever when it's the next focus area.

---

## The Metrics That Matter

**For audience:** Not just followers—engagement and email subscribers. The people who actually care, not the ones who passively followed once.

**For product:** Not just revenue—customer satisfaction and retention. The people who stay, not the ones who tried once.

The vanity metrics (follower counts, revenue numbers) can mislead. The quality metrics (engagement, retention) tell you if you're building something sustainable.

---

## The Integrated Vision

Stop thinking of audience and product as competing activities.

Audience without product is incomplete. Product without audience is incomplete. Together, they create something sustainable and scalable.

Build both. Build them simultaneously. Let each inform the other.
