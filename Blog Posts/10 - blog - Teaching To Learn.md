# Teaching To Learn

You don't truly know something until you can explain it simply. And you can't explain it simply until you know it deeply.

Most people learn to teach. First they study, then they master, then—maybe—they share what they know.

The best people reverse it. They teach to learn. Explaining something forces you to understand it at a depth that studying alone never reaches.

Teaching is the fastest way to expose what you don't know.

## The Passive Learning Trap

You've read dozens of papers. You've watched hundreds of tutorials. You understand concepts when you're consuming them.

Then someone asks you to explain it. And you can't.

This is the passive learning trap. Consumption creates the illusion of understanding. You recognize concepts when you see them, so you assume you understand them. But recognition and understanding are different skills.

You can read about neural networks for a year and still not be able to explain backpropagation to a curious friend. The consumption pattern never forced you to confront the gaps.

## Why Teaching Works

Teaching forces three things that passive learning doesn't:

**Confrontation with gaps.** When you try to explain something, the holes in your understanding become immediately visible. You can't handwave to yourself the way you can when reading.

**Organization of chaos.** Knowledge from consumption is scattered—notes everywhere, half-remembered concepts, fragments of ideas. Teaching forces you to organize that chaos into coherent frameworks.

**Simplification through depth.** You can only explain something simply if you understand it deeply. Jargon is a crutch for incomplete understanding. Clear explanation requires real mastery.

The act of teaching isn't separate from learning—it's the final stage of learning that most people skip.

## The Evidence Is Everywhere

Look at the people who actually master complex domains:

Andrej Karpathy's blog posts force him to understand neural networks from first principles. The teaching isn't a byproduct of his expertise—it's how he built it. Each post requires him to understand well enough to explain clearly.

Lilian Weng writes technical deep-dives that become the standard reference in AI. The writing process forces clarity. She can't publish until she understands deeply enough to explain simply.

Jay Alammar creates visual explanations that require him to understand concepts deeply enough to illustrate them. You can't draw something you don't understand.

They didn't master the material and then decide to teach it. Teaching was the mechanism of mastery.

## The Feynman Method

Richard Feynman understood this:

1. Choose a concept
2. Explain it as if teaching a beginner
3. Identify gaps in your explanation
4. Go back to the source and fill the gaps
5. Simplify and use analogies

This loop is deceptively simple and remarkably powerful. The beginner framing is key—you can't hide behind jargon when explaining to someone who doesn't know the terminology.

When you can't explain something simply, that's exactly what you need to study next. The failure to explain is a diagnostic tool pointing at your ignorance.

## The Expertise Objection

"But I'm not an expert yet—I have no business teaching others."

This is backwards. You don't need expertise to teach. Teaching is how you build expertise.

The person one step ahead of you can often teach better than the world expert. They remember the confusion. They haven't automated their understanding to the point where they forget what was hard.

Teach what you're currently learning. Your inexperience is an asset—you're close to the struggle, which makes your explanations more relatable.

The fear of teaching before you're ready is actually fear of discovering your gaps. But discovering gaps is the point. That's what accelerates your learning.

## The Practical Implementation

**After learning any concept, immediately write an explanation.** Not notes for yourself—an explanation for someone else. The audience framing forces clarity.

**Create a public channel for teaching.** A blog, newsletter, video series—anything that commits you to explaining. The public commitment prevents you from abandoning the practice when it gets hard.

**Teach one concept per week, regardless of expertise level.** Consistency matters more than credentials. You'll learn faster teaching imperfectly every week than studying privately forever.

**Find someone one step behind you and teach them what you just learned.** This is the fastest feedback loop. Their confusion points directly at your gaps.

**Build visual explanations, code examples, and analogies.** Each format forces a different kind of understanding. If you can only explain verbally, you don't fully understand.

---

## The Speed Advantage

Here's the counterintuitive truth: teaching doesn't slow down your learning—it accelerates it.

Yes, teaching takes time. Writing a blog post is slower than reading one. Creating an explanation is harder than consuming one.

But the depth of understanding you get from teaching exceeds what you'd get from consuming in the same time. You learn faster by teaching than by reading more.

The person who reads ten papers understands less than the person who reads three papers and teaches one of them.

---

## The Gift That Gives Back

Teaching has a second-order benefit: it creates reputation.

While you're using teaching to learn, others see you as an expert teaching. Your learning process becomes content. Your education becomes distribution.

This isn't cynical—it's efficient. You're doing the work you need to do to learn anyway. Making it public adds value for others and builds your reputation simultaneously.

## Start Today

You learn by consuming. You master by teaching.

Pick one concept you think you understand. Write an explanation for someone who knows nothing about it. Notice where you get stuck. That's your curriculum.

The fastest way to the bottom is explaining it to someone else.
