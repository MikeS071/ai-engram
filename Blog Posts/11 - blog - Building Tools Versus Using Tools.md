# Building Tools Versus Using Tools

Tool users scale linearly. Tool builders scale exponentially.

Using tools makes you productive. Building tools makes you powerful. Most people optimize for immediate output and trap themselves in permanent dependence.

The carpenter who only uses hammers stays a carpenter forever. The carpenter who builds hammers becomes irreplaceable.

## The User Trap

You've mastered your tools. You're a power user. You know every shortcut, every configuration, every optimization.

But you're limited by what the tool allows you to do.

When the tool doesn't do what you need, you adapt your work to fit the tool. When the tool has a bug, you wait for someone else to fix it. When the tool stops being maintained, you panic.

This is productive dependence. You're efficient within constraints you didn't choose and can't change.

I've watched this pattern for thirty years. The people who hit ceilings are almost always people who optimized for tool usage instead of tool creation. They're productive within limits, but they can't break through to the next level because breaking through requires changing the constraints—and they don't have that power.

## The Builder Advantage

Simon Willison co-created Django. When he needed to explore data, he didn't find a tool—he built Datasette. When he wanted to experiment with LLMs, he didn't wait for the perfect interface—he built tools to interact with them.

Each tool solved his specific problem better than any general tool could. But more importantly: each tool he built expanded what was possible for him to do next.

This is the exponential advantage. Tool users scale linearly with effort—twice the work, twice the output. Tool builders scale exponentially—each tool multiplies what they can do with the same effort.

Eugene Yan builds custom ML systems at Amazon instead of using off-the-shelf solutions. The systems fit his specific context better than any generic tool. And the capability to build tools means he's never blocked by what exists.

## The Real Calculation

"But isn't building tools a distraction from the actual work?"

Do the math.

If you use a tool that has friction, that friction adds up. Let's say it costs you one hour per week in workarounds, waiting, or adapting to limitations. That's 52 hours per year. Over five years, that's 260 hours—nearly seven full work weeks.

Now imagine you spent two days building a tool that eliminated that friction. Two days invested, seven weeks saved over five years. That's the builder's ROI.

The calculation gets even better when you consider what you learn by building. Understanding how your tools work makes you better at using all tools. Building one tool teaches skills that apply to building the next.

## The Dependence Test

Here's how to know if you're too dependent on tools:

Can you survive if your primary tool disappears? Can you explain how it works underneath? Could you build a simplified version if you needed to?

If the answers are no, you've traded capability for convenience. You're productive within a context you don't control.

This isn't about building everything from scratch—that's inefficient and impractical. It's about having the capability to build when building is the right choice. The option to build is power, even when you choose not to exercise it.

## When to Build

Not every friction deserves a custom tool. Here's the filter I use:

**Build when you use something 3+ times per week and feel friction.** Repeated friction with frequently used tools is a clear signal. The investment will pay off through repeated use.

**Build when existing tools force you to adapt your work to fit them.** If you're changing your process to accommodate tool limitations, those limitations are costing you more than time.

**Build when understanding the tool would make you fundamentally better.** Some tools are worth building not for the output, but for what you learn building them.

**Don't build when existing tools work well enough.** "Good enough" is actually good enough for most things. Reserve building energy for high-friction, high-frequency situations.

---

## The Learning Path

If you've never built tools, start small:

**Study the tools you use daily.** How do they work underneath? What are they abstracting? Understanding this is the foundation for building.

**Contribute to open source tools.** You don't need to build from scratch. Improving existing tools teaches you how tools are built while providing immediate value.

**Build one custom tool per quarter.** Small scope, specific problem, real usage. The habit of building is more important than the size of what you build.

**Share your tools publicly.** Tool builders attract opportunities. People who see what you build assume you can build more.

## The Mindset Shift

Stop asking "Is there a tool for this?" Start asking "How would I build this?"

You don't have to actually build everything. But thinking about how you would build changes your relationship with tools. You see them as implementations of principles, not magic boxes. You understand their limitations because you can imagine how they were made.

This mindset shift is valuable even if you never build a tool. It makes you a better user because you understand what you're using.

---

## The Long Game

Tool users are productive. Tool builders are powerful.

Users adapt their work to fit existing tools. Builders create tools that fit their vision. Over time, the compounding difference is massive.

You don't need to build everything. But you need the capability to build when building is the right choice. That capability is power—the power to never be blocked by what exists, the power to create exactly what you need, the power to scale exponentially instead of linearly.
