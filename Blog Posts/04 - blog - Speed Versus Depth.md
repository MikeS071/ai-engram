# Speed Versus Depth

Everyone is optimizing for velocity. No one is optimizing for permanence.

The internet rewards speed—daily posts, constant shipping, rapid iteration. Move fast and break things. Ship it Friday. Build in public. The algorithm rewards consistency, and consistency means volume.

But mastery demands something different. Months of invisible work. Obsessive refinement. Understanding so complete it looks like magic.

Move fast and break things. Move slow and build cathedrals. Both are true. Neither is wrong. The art is knowing when each applies.

## The Speed Trap

You ship every day but can't point to anything you're proud of from a year ago. Sound familiar?

I've watched talented builders exhaust themselves on the content treadmill. Daily posts, weekly newsletters, constant shipping. They're productive by every metric except the one that matters: they haven't created anything that lasts.

The internet confuses activity with progress. Everyone is sprinting toward mediocrity because they're terrified of the silence that comes with depth. The algorithm stops rewarding you the moment you pause. So you never pause. And you never build anything timeless.

Speed gets you attention. Depth gets you remembered.

## The Depth Illusion

"But isn't perfectionism just another form of procrastination?"

Sometimes, yes. Depth can become an excuse to never ship. You polish endlessly because you're afraid to be judged. You call it quality control; it's actually avoidance.

Real depth is different. It's not polishing the same work forever—it's going deeper into understanding until something genuinely new emerges. Lilian Weng doesn't publish 3-4 posts per year because she's perfecting sentences. She publishes rarely because each piece requires genuine insight that takes months to develop.

The question isn't "speed or depth?" It's "what does this project actually require?"

## The Two Modes

After thirty years building systems, I've learned that projects divide naturally into two categories.

**Fast projects** (weeks): Experiments, tests, explorations. Things where learning speed matters more than polish. Ship early, iterate quickly, don't attach your identity to the outcome. These build skill and momentum.

**Deep projects** (months to years): Your masterwork. The thing you want to be known for in a decade. These require obsessive refinement, protected time, and the willingness to delay gratification for permanent impact.

Most people ship everything at speed-project pace, including their masterwork. That's why so few people create anything legendary.

The builders I admire—Karpathy, Lilian Weng, Ben Thompson—they ship small experiments fast. But their signature work? Months of invisible development before the world sees anything.

## What Depth Actually Looks Like

Andrej Karpathy spends months on blog posts that reshape how people understand neural networks. Those posts get referenced for years. They become the standard explanation.

Lilian Weng publishes technical deep-dives that take weeks to write but serve thousands for years. While everyone else chases engagement, she builds permanent resources.

Chip Huyen writes comprehensive guides that aren't optimized for viral sharing—they're optimized for being genuinely useful over long timeframes.

This is what depth produces: work that's still relevant five years later. Work that becomes the foundation other people build on. Work that justifies itself by lasting.

## The Practical Split

Here's what I've learned about balancing speed and depth:

**Identify the project type before starting.** Is this a fast experiment or a deep investment? Most projects are fast. But you need at least one deep project per year that you'll obsess over until it's legendary.

**Build speed projects to fund depth projects.** Fast work generates income, attention, and momentum. That buys you the space for deep work. Don't feel guilty about shipping quick experiments—they're not your legacy, they're your runway.

**Never ship your masterwork before it's ready.** When tempted to ship early, ask: "Will I be proud of this in three years?" If the answer is uncertain, it's not ready.

**Study creators whose work from five years ago is still relevant today.** That's your benchmark for depth. If their old work still matters, they understood something about permanence.

## The Patience Test

Depth requires patience the algorithm doesn't reward.

You'll disappear for months while others gain followers. You'll feel behind while everyone ships daily. You'll wonder if you're being disciplined or delusional.

This is the test. The people creating timeless work have all passed it. They chose silence and obsession over constant visibility. They trusted that permanent impact beats temporary attention.

The fastest way to create something timeless is to move slowly enough to get it right.
