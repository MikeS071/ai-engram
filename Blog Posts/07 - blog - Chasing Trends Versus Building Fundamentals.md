# Chasing Trends Versus Building Fundamentals

The cutting edge dulls. Foundations last forever.

Every new AI model promises to change everything. Every framework claims to be the future. Every week brings revolutionary tools that demand your immediate attention.

Yet the people who master fundamentals adapt instantly to each new wave, while trend-chasers restart from zero with every shift. Same pattern, decade after decade.

Chase trends, stay busy, stay broke. Master fundamentals, stay ready, stay relevant.

## The Trend Trap

You learn the latest framework only to watch it get replaced six months later. You master the hot tool, and a better one launches before you ship anything. You stay "current" by running constantly but never arriving anywhere.

I've watched this cycle for thirty years. New technology appears. Everyone rushes to learn it. By the time they're proficient, the replacement emerges. Rinse and repeat until burnout.

The anxiety is real: "Won't I fall behind if I don't learn the latest tools?" So you stay on the treadmill, confusing movement with progress. You know surface-level details about everything but have deep understanding of nothing.

Here's what nobody tells you: the fundamentals that mattered in 1995 still matter today. The frameworks changed dozens of times. The principles beneath them barely shifted.

## What Trends Actually Are

Trends are marketing. Fundamentals are reality.

Every "revolutionary" tool is just a new interface for old principles. React is a new way to manage state and render UI. Kubernetes is a new way to orchestrate distributed systems. LLMs are a new way to do pattern matching at scale.

The interfaces change. The mathematics, the distributed systems principles, the data structures, the algorithms—these persist across every trend cycle.

When you understand fundamentals, you see new tools for what they are: implementations of principles you already understand. Learning them becomes a weekend project, not a career pivot.

## The Fundamental Advantage

Andrej Karpathy explains neural networks from first principles. That explanation works for every new model because the principles persist across architectures. He doesn't need to relearn the foundations when GPT-5 drops.

Lilian Weng breaks down complex papers by returning to foundational concepts. Her old posts are still referenced because she taught principles, not tools.

Eugene Yan's production ML advice works regardless of which framework you choose. He teaches thinking, not syntax.

This is the fundamental advantage: the ability to adapt instantly because you understand the substrate beneath every surface change.

## What Fundamentals Actually Means

Let me be specific, because "learn fundamentals" sounds like generic advice.

**For AI/ML:** Linear algebra, probability, statistics, optimization theory. These haven't changed significantly in decades. Every new model is built on them.

**For software:** Data structures, algorithms, systems design, database theory. The implementations change; the concepts don't.

**For building businesses:** Human psychology, economics, communication, distribution. Marketing tactics change quarterly. Human motivation barely changes per century.

When a new tool appears, ask: "What fundamental problem does this solve?" The answer tells you whether it's a genuine shift or just a new interface for old work.

## The 80/20 Split

Here's the practical framework I use:

**Spend 80% of learning time on fundamentals.** The things that will still matter in ten years. Mathematics, first principles, core concepts that underlie every implementation.

**Spend 20% on current tools.** Enough to be functional, not enough to be dependent. Learn the tool well enough to use it, but understand the principles well enough to switch tools easily.

Most people invert this ratio. They spend 80% on current tools and 20% on fundamentals—then wonder why they feel constantly behind despite constant learning.

## The Fundamental Test

Before learning any new tool, ask:

- What principle does this implement?
- Do I understand that principle deeply?
- Will this tool still exist in five years?
- Could I build a simplified version from scratch?

If you understand the principle deeply, learning the tool is fast. If you don't understand the principle, no amount of tool mastery will make up for the gap.

The people who feel constantly behind are usually running fast in the wrong direction. They're collecting tools when they should be building understanding.

---

## The Long Game

Read papers and books from five to ten years ago. What still matters? That's your curriculum.

Build projects from scratch before using high-level frameworks. The struggle teaches you what the framework abstracts away.

When everyone rushes to the new thing, go deeper into the old thing. The crowd is usually wrong about what matters, and by the time they realize it, you'll have the fundamental depth they lack.

Master mathematics, statistics, and first principles before chasing LLM wrappers. The wrappers will change. The mathematics won't.

## The Trend-Resistant Career

The people who thrive across every technology shift share this trait: they invested in fundamentals early and continuously.

They adapted to the web, to mobile, to cloud, to AI—not because they were early adopters of each trend, but because they understood the principles that made each trend work.

You can build this same resilience. Stop learning frameworks. Start learning the principles frameworks implement. The cutting edge becomes obsolete. The fundamentals become legendary.
