# Betting On Yourself Versus Following Proven Paths

The proven path was forged by someone who bet on themselves.

Proven paths guarantee average outcomes. Betting on yourself risks total failure. Yet the only way to achieve extraordinary results is to abandon the path everyone takes and forge your own.

Following the path is safe. Creating the path is terrifying. One leads to comfort. One leads to legend.

## The Proven Path Trap

You followed the "right" path. Good school, good job, good trajectory. Safe decisions that minimized risk at every juncture.

And now you're somewhere you don't want to be.

The proven path is optimized for the average person to achieve average outcomes with minimum risk. That's the design. It works exactly as intended—delivering predictable, moderate results to anyone who follows it.

But you're not average. And average outcomes aren't what you want.

The proven path has lower failure rates, yes. It also has a ceiling. The extraordinary outcomes you dream about? They're not on this path. They're on paths that don't exist yet—paths that require someone to create them.

## The Bet-On-Yourself Examples

Ben Thompson left traditional tech journalism to build Stratechery. There was no proven path for independent paid newsletters at the time. He created the category by betting on himself.

Dan Koe built a million-dollar one-person business without formal credentials. No employer gave him permission. No institution validated his approach. He bet on himself and created something that proved its own value.

Chip Huyen left NVIDIA to work on ML education and infrastructure in unconventional ways. The safe path was clear. She chose the interesting path.

Notice what they have in common: they didn't follow a path—they created one. And they created it by betting that their vision was worth pursuing even when nobody else validated it.

## The Survivorship Bias Objection

"Isn't this just survivorship bias from people who got lucky?"

Fair question. For every Ben Thompson, there are people who bet on themselves and failed.

But here's what the survivorship bias objection misses: the people who followed the proven path also mostly failed to achieve extraordinary outcomes. They just failed safely. Their failure looked like comfort, stability, and decades of quiet unfulfillment.

Both paths have failure modes. The proven path fails into mediocrity. Betting on yourself fails into learning and another attempt.

The question isn't whether you might fail—you might fail either way. The question is which failure you can live with.

## The Golden Handcuffs

You see others living the life you want. You have potential you'll never explore. But you're trapped by golden handcuffs—the salary, the benefits, the stability that makes the proven path comfortable even when it's unfulfilling.

The trap isn't the handcuffs. It's believing they're locked.

Calculate your runway. How long could you survive betting on yourself before needing to return to the safe path? Six months? A year? Three years? That's not trapped—that's optionality.

The golden handcuffs feel permanent because you've never measured them. Measure them. The number is probably smaller than you think, which means the escape is more possible than you believe.

## The Betting Framework

**Identify where you're following the path because it's safe, not because it's right.** Be honest about which decisions are defensive and which are aligned with what you actually want.

**Calculate your real runway.** Not the comfortable estimate—the actual number. How long could you survive on savings while betting on yourself?

**Set a deadline.** If you don't make the leap by X date, you never will. The deadline creates commitment. Without it, "someday" means "never."

**Build skills and assets while employed.** Use the stability of the proven path to prepare for departure. Learn, build, create—all while someone else pays your bills. Then leap with momentum.

**Start the unconventional path as a side project.** You don't have to jump suddenly. Build the alternative while maintaining the safety net. When the alternative proves itself, the leap becomes smaller.

## The 60% Rule

When you feel 60% ready to leap, leap.

You'll never feel 100% ready. The proven path always feels safer because it is safer—that's the point. Waiting for certainty is waiting forever.

60% ready means you have enough runway, enough skills, and enough of a plan to survive the initial period. The remaining 40% you figure out after you leap.

The people who made successful bets on themselves will tell you they weren't ready. They were just ready enough—and the leap itself created the rest.

---

## The Real Risk

You think the risk is betting on yourself. The real risk is never discovering your ceiling.

The proven path gives you a predictable outcome. You can calculate approximately where it leads. There are no surprises. But there's also no discovery—no finding out what you're actually capable of when you're not constrained by safe decisions.

Betting on yourself is the only way to find out what's possible. You might discover you're capable of far more than the proven path would ever reveal. Or you might discover limitations. Either way, you'll know—instead of always wondering.

---

## The Decision

Proven paths are optimized for the average person to achieve average outcomes with minimum risk.

If average outcomes are what you want, the path exists. Follow it.

But if you want something more—something that doesn't exist on any path yet—you'll have to create it. And creating it requires betting on yourself, despite the risk, despite the uncertainty, despite everyone telling you the safe path is smarter.

The proven path guarantees you'll reach where others have already been. Betting on yourself is the only way to go somewhere new.
