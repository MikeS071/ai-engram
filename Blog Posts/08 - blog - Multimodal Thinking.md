# Multimodal Thinking

The most powerful insights don't live in text, or images, or code—they live in the space between them.

Multimodal AI is revolutionary, they say. Models that learn from text, vision, and audio to understand the world more completely. Breakthrough technology.

But here's the irony: multimodal thinking is prehistoric. Humans used to think this way naturally—across formats, disciplines, and modes of understanding. We forgot how to do it.

Now we trap ourselves in single-mode thinking, consuming only what fits our comfortable format, missing the insights that live between disciplines.

## The Single-Mode Prison

You read text. That's how you learn. Articles, books, papers, threads. Text in, text out.

Or maybe you're visual. Videos, diagrams, infographics. Or audio—podcasts while you commute, audiobooks while you exercise.

Whatever your preferred mode, you've probably optimized for it. Algorithms learned what you like. Recommendations narrowed. Your information diet became increasingly homogeneous.

The problem: different modes reveal different truths.

Some concepts only make sense when visualized. Some insights only emerge through verbal explanation. Some connections only appear when you see the code. By trapping yourself in one mode, you miss everything that mode can't capture.

## What You're Missing

Jay Alammar made transformers understandable through visual explanations. His illustrated guides revealed insights that text-only explanations obscured for years. The same concepts, made visible, suddenly clicked.

Andrej Karpathy teaches through code, visualization, and explanation simultaneously. The combination creates understanding that any single format misses. You see the math, run the code, hear the reasoning—and suddenly the concept integrates.

Dan Koe synthesizes philosophy, business, psychology, and fitness into frameworks that none of those disciplines would produce alone. The insight lives at the intersection of fields, not within any single one.

This is what multimodal thinking produces: perspectives that are impossible when you stay in one format or one discipline.

## The Cross-Discipline Advantage

Sebastian Ruder's work on multilingual AI required thinking beyond English-only models. That constraint—working across languages—revealed patterns that monolingual researchers missed.

Ben Thompson analyzes tech through business strategy, economics, and product design lenses simultaneously. Pure tech analysts miss the business dynamics. Pure business analysts miss the technical constraints. The synthesis creates insight.

Packy McCormick connects tech, culture, finance, and business in combinations that no single-discipline expert would make. His newsletter works because he refuses to stay in one lane.

The future belongs to people who think across modes and disciplines—not because breadth beats depth, but because the connections between domains are where breakthrough insights hide.

## How AI Got This Right

There's something worth learning from how multimodal AI works.

These systems don't prefer one modality. They learn from everything—text describes images, images ground text, audio adds temporal understanding. The combination produces capabilities that no single modality achieves alone.

Your brain works the same way, except you've trained it to prefer one input mode. You've optimized for comfort at the cost of capability.

Retrain yourself. Consume across modes deliberately, not accidentally.

## The Multimodal Practice

**Consume the same concept through multiple formats.** Read an explanation, watch a video, study a diagram, run the code. The redundancy isn't waste—it's integration. Each format reveals something the others miss.

**Create across modes.** If you normally write, try diagramming. If you normally speak, try drawing. The friction of unfamiliar formats forces deeper understanding. You can't fake it when you're outside your comfortable mode.

**Study one concept from multiple disciplines' perspectives.** How do economists think about this? Psychologists? Engineers? Biologists? The same phenomenon looks different from different disciplines, and the differences are informative.

**When stuck, switch modalities.** Can't write it? Draw it. Can't explain it verbally? Code it. Can't code it? Sketch it on paper. The modality switch often unlocks what was stuck.

## The Discipline of Discomfort

This isn't comfortable advice. You have preferred formats for a reason—they're easier for you. Switching modes feels inefficient.

But efficiency in one mode is limitation in disguise. You're optimizing for speed within a constraint that limits your potential.

The most capable thinkers I know force themselves into unfamiliar modes regularly. They write, diagram, code, speak, and visualize—not because they're equally good at all of them, but because the struggle to translate between modes builds understanding that comfort never achieves.

---

## The Integration Payoff

Here's what happens when you develop multimodal thinking:

You start seeing connections others miss because they're trapped in single formats. You can explain concepts to diverse audiences because you've internalized them through multiple modes. You develop the rare ability to extract insights from anywhere and synthesize them into something genuinely new.

Most importantly, you become anti-fragile to format shifts. When new modes emerge—VR, AR, neural interfaces, whatever comes next—you'll adapt easily because you've already trained yourself to think across formats.

Single-mode thinkers will struggle to adapt. You'll already be there.

---

## The Choice

You can keep optimizing your preferred format. Get really, really good at consuming text (or video, or audio). Become efficient within your chosen lane.

Or you can develop multimodal thinking. Deliberately consume and create across formats. Study how different disciplines solve similar problems. Build the synthesis skills to connect insights that exist in different modes.

The first path is easier. The second path creates the rare ability to see what others can't—because they never look where you're looking.
