# Open Source Versus Product

Give everything away. Charge for everything. Both are wrong. Both are right.

Open source makes you known. Products make you wealthy. You need both, but most people trap themselves in one, mistaking visibility for value or revenue for impact.

I've watched brilliant builders fail on both sides of this divide. Amazing open source work that can't pay rent. Profitable products that nobody knows exist. The solution isn't choosing a side—it's understanding how they fuel each other.

## The Open Source Trap

You built something amazing. It's elegant, useful, maybe even beautiful. People star your repo, fork your code, and tweet praise. You feel successful.

Then rent comes due.

GitHub stars don't convert to dollars. Community respect doesn't pay for groceries. You've built reputation without revenue, and the irony is painful: your free work enabled products that someone else monetized.

Open source is for people who already have money or fame, right? It can feel that way. But the trap isn't open source itself—it's treating visibility as the final destination instead of the foundation for something more.

## The Product Trap

You built something valuable. It works. Customers pay for it. You've achieved product-market fit without any public presence.

Now try to grow.

No one knows you exist. Your customers found you through luck or expensive ads. You have no distribution, no trust, no reputation that precedes you. Every sale requires starting from scratch.

Product without distribution is invisible value. You're doing good work in private while competitors with worse products but better distribution eat your market share.

## The Strategic Integration

The best businesses are built on open foundations with commercial layers.

Simon Willison co-created Django and built Datasette open source. He monetizes through tools and consulting. His open source work proved his capabilities and built trust. His commercial work captures the value that reputation enables.

Andrej Karpathy shares education freely while working on cutting-edge commercial AI. The teaching builds his reputation. The commercial work pays for his time to teach more.

Chip Huyen writes comprehensive free guides while building production AI platforms commercially. She gives away the knowledge. She charges for the execution.

Notice the pattern: they're not choosing between open source and product. They're using each to fuel the other.

## The Strategic Layer Cake

Here's the framework I've seen work repeatedly:

**Open source your tools and frameworks.** This builds reputation, distribution, and trust. People use your work, learn from it, recommend it. You become known as someone who creates value.

**Monetize your application and execution.** The tools are free. What you build with them—and for whom—is where you capture value. You've proven you can create; now you charge for specific implementations.

**Give away the "what" and "why."** Share your knowledge freely. Explain your approaches. Let people learn from your thinking. This isn't charity—it's distribution.

**Sell the "how" and "done for you."** Knowledge is free. Expertise is expensive. The gap between knowing what to do and actually doing it well? That's where the money lives.

## The Objection: Won't Someone Copy Me?

"If I open source it, someone will just copy it and beat me."

Maybe. But consider the alternative: you build in private, and someone builds the same thing in public. They get the reputation. They get the distribution. They get the trust that comes from proving their work openly.

The reality is that most people won't copy your work. They'll use it, appreciate it, and come to you when they need something custom. Your open work is a filter—it attracts the people who value what you create.

And the few who do copy and compete? They were going to compete anyway. At least this way you started with the reputation advantage.

## The Funding Loop

Here's what sustainable creator businesses look like:

Open source builds reputation and distribution → Reputation attracts paying customers → Revenue funds more open source → More open source builds more reputation.

This is a flywheel, not a one-time transaction. Your free work and your commercial work feed each other continuously. Neither is wasted effort.

The people who struggle are the ones who see this as an either/or choice. They either give everything away hoping for magical monetization, or they build in private hoping for magical discovery. Both approaches break because they ignore half the equation.

## What to Do This Week

**Identify what you're currently building.** Where does it fall—pure open source or pure product? If it's either extreme, you're missing leverage.

**Open source something valuable.** Not your core product, but something that demonstrates your capabilities. A tool, a framework, an analysis. Something that proves you create value.

**Monetize the next layer.** What can you charge for that builds on your open work? Consulting, implementation, productized service, premium tools. The open work earns attention. The commercial layer captures value.

**Study companies built on open foundations.** How did they balance open and commercial? What's free and what costs money? These patterns are replicable.
