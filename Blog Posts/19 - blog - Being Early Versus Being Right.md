# Being Early Versus Being Right

The distance between visionary and delusional is measured in years, not arguments.

Being early and being wrong look identical for years. Being right on time means you missed the opportunity.

The biggest wins come from being early and having the conviction to outlast everyone who calls you wrong.

## The Timing Paradox

Early looks like failure. Right on time looks like following.

When you're early, there's no evidence you're right. The market hasn't validated your bet. The experts disagree. The consensus thinks you're wrong—or worse, crazy.

By the time there's evidence, you're not early anymore. You're right on time, which means you're competing with everyone else who waited for proof.

The paradox is inescapable: the biggest opportunities require betting before there's evidence, and betting before evidence looks exactly like being wrong.

## The Early Advantage

Ben Thompson bet on independent tech analysis before Substack made it obvious. Early. The years before the obvious moment were uncertain, but they gave him a head start that late entrants couldn't match.

Chip Huyen focused on MLOps and production ML before it became the standard. Early. When "MLOps" became a category, she was already the authority.

Dan Koe built one-person business frameworks before the creator economy matured. Early. When everyone else discovered the opportunity, he was already established.

Notice what they had in common: conviction during the lonely years. They committed before consensus validated them.

## The Distinguishing Problem

"But how do I know if I'm early or just wrong?"

This is the hardest question. Early and wrong are indistinguishable in real-time. Both feel uncertain. Both lack external validation. Both have critics pointing out why you're mistaken.

The honest answer: you can't know for certain. But you can improve your odds.

**Bet where you have unique insight.** Not random predictions—areas where your experience gives you information others don't have. Your unique vantage point is your edge.

**Look for inevitability with uncertain timing.** Some shifts are clearly coming; the question is when. "AI will transform software development" is more likely than "this specific framework will dominate." Bet on inevitable trends, not specific implementations.

**Find expert disagreement.** When all experts agree, the opportunity is already priced in. When experts disagree, someone is early and someone is wrong. The disagreement is where the opportunity hides.

## The Conviction Requirement

Being early requires conviction that survives doubt.

For years, you'll look wrong. People will explain why you're mistaken. You'll have moments of uncertainty where their arguments sound compelling.

The conviction isn't about being certain you're right. It's about believing the bet is worth taking despite uncertainty. You can be early and still have doubt—the skill is persisting anyway.

Build conviction through research, not consensus validation. The work you do to understand the trend deeply is what sustains you when the external signals are negative.

## The Timeline Factor

Give your early bets 3-5 years before judging success or failure.

This timeline matters. If you're truly early, one year of evidence tells you almost nothing. The market hasn't caught up. The technology hasn't matured. The adoption hasn't happened.

Too many people abandon early bets after one year because they expected faster validation. They weren't wrong—they were just impatient. The bet might have paid off if they'd waited.

The flip side: if you're wrong, longer timelines delay the reckoning. Five years is long enough to learn, short enough to pivot if needed.

## What Early Looks Like

Early looks like:
- Lonely. Few people agree with you.
- Uncertain. You can't prove you're right.
- Mocked by consensus. The smart people think you're mistaken.
- Financially unrewarded. The payoff hasn't arrived.
- Full of doubt. Even you wonder if you're wrong.

This is what early feels like. If it felt confident and validated, it wouldn't be early—it would be obvious.

## The Prediction Practice

Make public predictions about the future and track your accuracy.

Not because you need to be right every time—but because the practice sharpens your judgment. You learn which intuitions to trust. You learn what being early feels like versus being wrong.

The feedback loop takes years. That's fine. The practice compounds over time.

---

## The Risk Calculation

Being early has two failure modes:

**Too early:** You're right about the trend but wrong about timing. The opportunity existed but your resources ran out before it arrived.

**Actually wrong:** The trend you predicted doesn't materialize. Your thesis was incorrect.

Both feel the same in the moment. The mitigation is different:

For "too early": extend your runway. Have enough resources to outlast your timeline predictions.

For "actually wrong": stay open to disconfirming evidence. Have kill criteria—signals that would tell you the bet isn't working.

---

## The Conviction Payoff

Here's what happens when you're early and right:

The years of looking wrong become the moat. Your head start becomes insurmountable. When everyone else discovers the opportunity, you've already built the expertise, the audience, the reputation.

Being right on time means competing from scratch. Being early means competing from advantage.

The conviction to be early—and the resilience to outlast the doubt—is what separates those who capture opportunities from those who follow them.

*Being early looks like being wrong until suddenly it looks like being brilliant. The distance is measured in time and conviction, not evidence.*
