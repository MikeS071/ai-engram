# AI Commodifies Knowledge, Expertise Thrives

Everyone has access to infinite intelligence; almost no one has the discipline to build their own.

That's the paradox nobody's talking about.

We're living through the greatest democratization of information in human history. You can ask AI anything—complex technical questions, nuanced business strategy, obscure historical facts—and get competent answers in seconds. The knowledge gap has collapsed.

And yet.

Ben Thompson publishes 5,000-word analyses that AI could "summarize" in thirty seconds. 258,000 people pay $120 a year to read them anyway. Lilian Weng explains complex AI papers on her blog despite ChatGPT being able to explain them "faster." Dan Koe built a million-dollar one-person business by synthesizing ideas no AI would ever connect.

What's going on here?

## The Split Nobody Sees Coming

The AI revolution doesn't eliminate human expertise—it splits the world into two groups.

**Group One** outsources their thinking to AI. They ask questions, copy answers, move on. Their work becomes indistinguishable from everyone else using the same tools with the same prompts. They're efficient. They're also increasingly commoditized.

**Group Two** uses AI to amplify thinking they've already done. They bring frameworks, judgment, and synthesis to the table. AI accelerates their unique perspective instead of replacing it. They become irreplaceable.

Here's what I've learned after thirty years building enterprise systems: the value was never in knowing *what* to do. It was in knowing *why* this approach works here and fails there. It was the pattern recognition built from watching decisions play out across dozens of implementations.

Experience can't be prompted.

## The Expertise Paradox

This is counterintuitive, so let me say it clearly: **AI making knowledge instantly accessible is exactly what makes deep expertise more valuable.**

When everyone has the same information, synthesis becomes the differentiator. When anyone can generate competent content, original thinking becomes scarce. When AI handles the surface-level work, judgment about what matters becomes the premium skill.

The intelligence explosion commodifies information. But authentic insight becomes the new scarce resource.

Think about it. If I ask AI to explain microservices architecture, I get a solid answer. If I ask it whether microservices are right for *my specific situation*—with my team's capabilities, my timeline constraints, my legacy systems—I get generic hedging. The judgment call requires context that no prompt can fully capture.

That judgment comes from building things. From watching projects succeed and fail. From developing taste about what works.

## The Trap Most People Fall Into

The more you rely on AI for answers, the less you understand the fundamentals beneath. This is the quiet erosion happening everywhere.

You ask AI instead of thinking. You accept the first response instead of questioning it. You skip the struggle that builds real understanding.

Then one day you realize your work feels increasingly generic. You have the same tools as everyone else, the same access, the same templates. You've stopped developing the one thing that can't be commoditized: your own thinking.

This isn't a technology problem. It's a discipline problem.

## What to Actually Do About It

**Disappear to think.** Block 2-4 hours daily for deep work—no AI, just you wrestling with problems. This is where original thinking happens.

**Build pattern recognition first.** Consume widely, then synthesize without prompting AI. Form opinions before checking consensus. The struggle is the point.

**Write to clarify, not to produce.** Writing isn't content creation—it's how you discover what you actually think. The byproduct might be a blog post. The real value is sharpened thinking.

**Capture your unique insights.** You have hard-won knowledge trapped in your brain. Build a system to extract and connect it. This becomes an intellectual asset no AI can replicate.

**Develop taste through public bets.** Make predictions. Take positions before they're validated. Right or wrong, you'll build judgment that generic AI outputs never will.

## The Real Opportunity

Here's what I want you to see: this moment isn't a threat to expertise. It's the greatest opportunity experts have ever had.

AI handles the commodity work—the summaries, the first drafts, the research compilation. That frees you to focus entirely on what actually differentiates you: the synthesis, the judgment, the original connections between ideas.

Human as architect, AI as executor. That's the model.

But it only works if you've built something worth amplifying. If you've done the thinking. If you've developed the expertise that can direct AI toward outcomes it would never find alone.

The question isn't whether AI will change everything. It already has.

The question is whether you'll be in the group that gets commoditized—or the group that becomes irreplaceable.

*Everyone has access to infinite intelligence. The discipline to build your own? That's still rare. And it's still yours to develop.*
