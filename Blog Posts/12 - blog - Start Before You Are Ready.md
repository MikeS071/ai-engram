# Start Before You're Ready

You'll never feel ready. Start anyway. Ready is something you become by doing.

Everyone waits until they're "ready" to start. More preparation. More learning. More credentials. Then—finally—they'll begin.

But readiness is earned through starting, not achieved before it. The people who wait for readiness stay waiting forever.

Preparation is procrastination dressed in productive clothing.

## The Readiness Myth

You're waiting to start until you've learned enough. But "enough" never arrives.

There's always more to know. Always another skill to develop. Always another gap to fill before you're "qualified." The finish line of preparation keeps moving because preparation isn't actually a destination—it's a hiding place.

I've watched this pattern destroy potential for three decades. Talented people trapped in endless study, waiting for permission that never comes. Meanwhile, less-qualified people succeed because they started while others prepared.

The gap between where you are and where you want to be? It doesn't close through preparation. It closes through action. The only way to learn what you're missing is to start and find out.

## What Starting Actually Looks Like

Andrej Karpathy didn't start his blog as an expert. He started as someone learning publicly. The expertise came from the starting, not before it.

Dan Koe built his one-person business before having all the answers. He learned by building, not by preparing to build.

Simon Willison experiments with AI tools daily, publishing experiments as he learns. He doesn't wait until he's mastered the technology—he learns by using it publicly.

Notice the pattern: none of them felt ready when they started. Ready is a destination they reached by walking, not a ticket they bought before the journey.

## The Exposure Fear

"But won't starting before I'm ready just expose my incompetence?"

Yes. That's the point.

Your incompetence is already there—hiding it doesn't make it go away. Starting exposes it to you, which is the only way to fix it. The gaps you discover through action are the curriculum you couldn't have known you needed.

The alternative is worse: hidden incompetence that never gets addressed because you never confronted it. You can prepare for years and still be incompetent in ways preparation couldn't reveal.

Public failure is embarrassing. Private stagnation is tragic. Choose wisely.

## The Permission Trap

"Don't I need credentials, skills, and experience before anyone will listen?"

This is the permission trap. You're waiting for someone to qualify you—a degree, a job title, a certain number of years.

But no one is coming to give you permission. The people you admire didn't wait for credentials. They built credentials by starting. Their authority came from doing the work, not from being authorized to do it.

Every "qualified" person you respect was once an unqualified person who started anyway. The qualification came after, not before.

## The Starting Method

**Set a deadline that's uncomfortably soon.** Not next month—this week. The discomfort is the point. Comfortable deadlines allow endless preparation.

**Commit publicly before you know how you'll finish.** Write the tweet, announce the project, set the launch date. Public commitment removes the option of indefinite preparation.

**Ship a terrible first version.** Not a mediocre version—a terrible one. Then improve it publicly. The permission you're waiting for comes from having shipped something, anything.

**Replace "I need to learn X first" with "I'll learn X while building Y."** Learning and building aren't sequential—they're parallel. You learn what you need when you need it, revealed by the act of building.

## The 50% Rule

When you feel 50% ready, start immediately.

This sounds reckless. It's actually optimized. At 50% readiness, you know enough to begin but not so much that you're over-preparing. The remaining 50% you learn through doing.

If you wait until you feel 100% ready, you've waited too long. You've over-invested in preparation when you could have been learning through action. And you probably still won't feel ready anyway—the bar keeps rising.

The people you admire? They started at 50% or less. The confidence you see is earned, not innate.

## The Journey Documentation

Document your journey from the beginning, especially the uncertain parts.

When you're starting, you think the messy beginning is something to hide. It's actually something to capture. The struggle is relatable. The uncertainty is authentic. The transformation is the story.

By the time you're successful, you'll have forgotten what struggling felt like. The documentation preserves what you can't remember later.

More importantly: documenting while learning accelerates the learning. It's teaching to learn, applied to your own journey.

## The Real Risk

You think the risk is starting too early. The real risk is starting too late—or never starting at all.

Every day you spend preparing is a day you could be learning through real action. Every course you take is a project you could be building. Every objection you raise is an excuse dressed as prudence.

The people you admire didn't feel ready. They started scared, learned through failure, and got ready on the way. That path is available to you too—if you stop waiting for a feeling that never comes.

## Start This Week

What are you waiting to start? What preparation feels necessary before you begin?

Now ask: what's the smallest version you could ship this week?

Not the polished version. Not the complete version. The smallest version that exists in the world instead of only in your plans.

Ship that. Then improve it. Then ship the improvement.

Ready is something you become by doing. You'll never feel ready. Start anyway.
