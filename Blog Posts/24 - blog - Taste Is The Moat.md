# Taste Is The Moat

In a world where anyone can build anything, the only question that matters is: do you know what's worth building?

AI can now write, design, code, and compose. Every technical skill is being commodified at breathtaking speed. The gap between an amateur and a professional just got smaller — not because amateurs got better, but because execution got cheap and scales infinitely.

But taste — knowing what to build, what to cut, what to ship, and what to kill — is getting more valuable by the hour.

Execution is cheap and scales infinitely. Taste doesn't.

## The Production Paradox

We've never had more tools for making things. And we've never had more forgettable things being made.

The bottleneck used to be production. If you could code, design, write, or compose, you had an advantage because most people couldn't. That advantage is disappearing. AI makes production accessible to anyone with an internet connection. The technical moat is flooding.

What remains when everyone can produce? Judgment. Discernment. The ability to recognize what's good, what's missing, and what needs to be removed.

This is taste. And it's the last human moat.

You can build anything but you don't know what's worth building. You ship more and more but nothing resonates because your filter is broken. You've confused productivity with quality and volume with impact. This is the production paradox — more output, less meaning.

## What Taste Actually Is

Taste isn't preference. Everyone has preferences. Taste is calibrated judgment — the eye that spots what others miss, the instinct that says "not yet" when everyone else says "ship it," and the courage to cut the thing you spent weeks building because it doesn't belong.

Steve Jobs couldn't engineer a computer. But he had the taste to know exactly what to remove from one. The result was products that felt inevitable — not because of what they included, but because of what they left out.

Music producers who can't play a single instrument hear the hit before anyone else in the room. The best editors — in writing, film, code — create by subtracting, not adding. They make things better by making them less.

Taste is knowing when something is done before the world tells you it's not enough. Chaos and simplicity. Genius and madness. It's a line, between two opposites, that most never touch.

## Why AI Can't Replace Taste

Here's the argument you'll hear: "AI can curate. AI can recommend. AI can evaluate quality. Taste will get commodified too."

It won't. And here's why.

AI optimizes for patterns in existing data. It can tell you what's been popular. It can mimic styles that have worked. But taste isn't about what's worked before — it's about recognizing what's about to work. It's the gap between analysis and intuition, between pattern-matching and pattern-breaking.

Taste is forged through wide exposure across disciplines, deep experience with failure, and the accumulation of judgment that comes from shipping things into the world and watching what happens. It's cross-domain — informed by art, music, architecture, food, film, conversation. You can't train it on a dataset because it isn't data. It's the human capacity to feel when something is right.

AI is the architect's best executor — cheap, fast, infinitely scalable. But the architect still needs to know what to build. That's the human job. That's taste.

## Developing Taste

Taste isn't innate talent. It's a skill built through deliberate exposure and ruthless editing. But it's the hardest skill because there's no certification, no course, and no metric that tells you when you have it.

**Study the best work obsessively.** Not to copy — to calibrate your filter. When you spend enough time with excellent work, mediocre work becomes physically uncomfortable. Your standards rise through absorption.

**Practice removing, not adding.** Edit your work until it hurts, then edit again. The instinct to add is easy. The instinct to cut is taste. What would you remove before you ask what you'd add?

**Consume widely across disciplines.** Taste is cross-domain. The designer who only studies design has narrow taste. The designer who studies architecture, film, cooking, and poetry has dimensional taste. Beauty follows patterns that repeat across every creative field.

**Develop strong opinions and defend them.** Taste requires conviction. "I think this is good" isn't taste. "This is good because of X, and this other thing fails because of Y" is taste. Be specific. Be willing to be wrong. But have a position.

**Surround yourself with people who have better taste than you.** Absorption is faster than instruction. You calibrate upward by proximity.

## Ship Less, But Make It Undeniable

The world doesn't need more creators. It needs better curators.

This runs against every piece of content advice you've heard. Post more. Ship faster. Volume wins. And in a world where production was the bottleneck, that advice was correct.

But production isn't the bottleneck anymore. AI handles that. The bottleneck is now taste — the filter that determines whether what you ship adds to the signal or adds to the noise.

Ship less. But make everything you ship undeniable. Let AI handle the cheap, scalable execution. You handle the direction. You be the architect. AI be the executor.

Be an artist and a capitalist. Build one thing, but don't be one thing. That tension — between volume and taste, between production and curation — is where the best work lives.

## The Taste Economy

We're entering the taste economy. Technical skill is table stakes. Production ability is commodity. The scarce resource — the thing that commands premium attention and premium value — is the ability to discern what's excellent from what's mediocre.

Taste isn't a soft skill. It's the hardest skill. And it's the only one that gets more valuable as machines get smarter.

*In five years, everyone will be able to build anything. The only question that matters is: do you know what's worth building? Taste is the last moat. Sharpen it or drown in noise.*
