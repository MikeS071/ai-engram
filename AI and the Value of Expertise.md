# AI and the Value of Expertise

Everyone has access to infinite intelligence now. But I wonder if people are seeing the shiny new toy as
a way to shortcut the effort that actually creates the value.

I've been thinking about this paradox a lot lately. We're living through the most dramatic transformation  in human history. You can ask ChatGPT anything and get an instant answer. Claude can write essays. Perplexity can research topics in seconds that used to take hours.

Yet Ben Thompson still has 258,000 people paying $120 a year to read his analysis of tech trends. Dan Koe built a million-dollar one-person business sharing ideas you could "just ask AI about." Lilian Weng explains complex AI research papers despite the fact that ChatGPT could explain them faster.

But what if we could connect our own unique life experiences, with those of others and augment this joined
up experience base with AI to create compelling points of view? More on that later.

What's currently happening?

AI makes knowledge instantly accessible to everyone, but deep expertise and original thinking have never been more valuable. The intelligence explosion commodifies information, yet authentic insight becomes the new scarce resource.

Here's what I'm starting to understand: there are two groups emerging. The first group outsources their thinking to AI. They use it for everything—writing, analysis, decision-making. They become efficient, sure. But they also become commoditized. Their work feels increasingly generic because everyone has the same tools, same access, same templates.

The second group uses AI to amplify thinking they've already done. They disappear for hours to think deeply, connect dots AI would never see, develop judgment through lived experience. Then they use AI as a tool for execution, not replacement for thought. These people become irreplaceable.

The gap between these two groups will define the new class divide. And I don't know about you, but throughout my entire adult life I have been a "director" not a "follower" and I would not want to be anything else. My individuality, my experience and my insights are what makes me unique. AI can't replace that - ever!

Think about it: you can ask AI anything now, but you've probably stopped thinking for yourself as much. Every time you hit a hard problem, there's a temptation to just prompt your way through it. The more you do this, the less you understand the fundamentals and patterns beneath.

Meanwhile, the people who are thriving aren't afraid of AI—they're building on top of it. Eugene Yan prototypes unique tools while working at Amazon scale, running experiments AI won't try. Dan Koe synthesizes ideas across philosophy, business, and psychology in ways no model would connect. Thompson writes analysis that goes beyond summarization into genuine strategic thinking.

What makes these people valuable isn't memorized knowledge. AI has infinite memory. It's judgment—knowing which ideas to connect, which questions to ask, which bets to make before they're validated.

So what do you do about it?

Become a generalist in what and how you consume information because that is what creates unique insights. The value of data or information isn't in singular collections, but rather in the interconnections between the various data that you have access to.

Start by reclaiming your thinking. Set aside some time daily (maybe an hour or two) to do deep work without AI. Build your pattern recognition by consuming widely, then synthesizing without prompting first. Write to clarify your thinking, not just to produce content.

Create a system to capture your unique insights before they're lost. Develop taste by making public predictions and watching what happens. Form strong opinions before checking consensus.

Most importantly, become a synthesizer. Connect dots between unrelated fields that AI wouldn't see. Build from your lived experience that no model can replicate.

Because here's the truth: AI doesn't eliminate human expertise. It reveals who actually has it and who was just good at looking things up.

The question isn't whether AI will replace you. It's whether you've been doing work that deserves to be replaced.

Build thinking AI can't reach. Everything else is already gone.
