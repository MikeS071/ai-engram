# Post Outline: Teaching To Learn

## POST OUTLINE 10:

### Core Paradox
Most people learn to teach. The best people teach to learn. Explaining something forces you to understand it at a depth that studying alone never reaches.

You don't truly know something until you can explain it simply. And you can't explain it simply until you know it deeply.

Teaching is the fastest way to expose what you don't know.

### Key Quotes
- "Known for making complex AI concepts accessible with original insights" - Lilian Weng's approach
- "A friendly introduction to machine learning compilers" - Chip Huyen teaching to understand
- "The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks" - Andrej Karpathy's legendary explanations
- Jay Alammar's visual ML explanations—teaching through new formats
- "Free online machine learning curriculum" - Chip Huyen organizing knowledge
- "Why You Should Do NLP Beyond English" - Sebastian Ruder teaching while learning

### Transformation Arc
From consuming content passively hoping to learn → realizing you can't explain what you thought you understood → starting to teach and discovering massive gaps in your knowledge → using teaching as a forcing function to learn deeply → becoming someone who masters through explanation

### Core Problems
- You've read dozens of papers but can't explain the core concepts to a friend
- You understand something when you're consuming it but can't recreate it from scratch
- You're stuck at surface-level knowledge and can't break through to mastery

### Key Examples
- Andrej Karpathy's blog posts that force him to understand neural networks from first principles
- Lilian Weng writing technical deep-dives that become the standard reference because teaching forces clarity
- Jay Alammar creating visual explanations that required him to understand concepts deeply enough to illustrate them

### Reader Objections
- "But I'm not an expert yet—I have no business teaching others"
- "Teaching takes time away from learning more advanced concepts"
- "What if I teach something wrong and look like a fraud?"

### Aspirational Statement
To accelerate your learning beyond what's possible through consumption alone, you must develop the courage to teach before you're ready, the discipline to explain concepts until you can make them simple, and the humility to let teaching expose your gaps so you can fill them.

### Actionable Steps
- After learning any concept, immediately write an explanation as if teaching a beginner
- Create a blog, newsletter, or video series explaining what you're currently learning
- When you can't explain something simply, that's what you need to study next
- Teach one concept per week publicly, regardless of your expertise level
- Use the Feynman technique: explain it in simple terms, identify gaps, fill them, simplify further
- Build visual explanations, code examples, and analogies to force deeper understanding
- Find someone one step behind you and teach them what you just learned

### Big Idea
Teaching isn't what you do after you've learned something—it's how you learn it in the first place. The act of explaining forces you to confront every gap in your understanding, organize chaotic knowledge into coherent frameworks, and achieve a depth that passive consumption never reaches.

### Memorable Closing Insight
You learn by consuming. You master by teaching. The fastest way to the bottom is explaining it to someone else.
