# Post Outline: Speed Versus Depth

## POST OUTLINE 4:

### Core Paradox
The internet rewards speed—daily posts, constant shipping, rapid iteration. But mastery demands depth—months of invisible work, obsessive refinement, understanding so complete it looks like magic.

Move fast and break things. Move slow and build cathedrals.

Everyone is optimizing for velocity. No one is optimizing for permanence.

### Key Quotes
- "Machine learning is going real-time" - Chip Huyen on speed trends
- "Real-time machine learning: challenges and solutions" - The technical complexity beneath
- "Deep Neural Nets: 33 years ago and 33 years from now" - Andrej Karpathy on long-term perspective
- Lilian Weng's deep technical posts that take weeks to write but are referenced for years
- "What I learned from looking at 900 most popular open source AI tools" - Chip Huyen's deep analysis
- Eugene Yan on "Applied ML in production" - The invisible depth behind working systems

### Transformation Arc
From believing speed equals success → shipping constantly but building nothing that lasts → watching others move slower but create legendary work → realizing depth and speed aren't opposites but different timeframes → learning when to sprint and when to obsess

### Core Problems
- You ship every day but can't point to anything you're proud of from a year ago
- You see others succeeding with less output and wonder what you're missing
- You're exhausted from constant production but your best work is still ahead of you

### Key Examples
- Lilian Weng publishing 3-4 deep technical posts per year that become the standard reference
- Andrej Karpathy spending months on blog posts that reshape how people understand neural networks
- Chip Huyen writing comprehensive guides that take weeks but serve thousands for years

### Reader Objections
- "But don't I need to ship daily to build an audience and stay relevant?"
- "Isn't perfectionism just another form of procrastination?"
- "The algorithm rewards consistency—how can I compete moving slow?"

### Aspirational Statement
To create work that lasts, you must develop the patience to obsess over single projects for months while others chase daily engagement, the conviction to refine until good becomes legendary, and the clarity to know which projects deserve speed and which demand depth.

### Actionable Steps
- Identify projects as either "fast" (weeks) or "deep" (months-years) before starting
- Commit to one deep project per year that you'll obsess over until it's legendary
- Ship small experiments fast, but never ship your masterwork before it's ready
- Study creators whose work from 5 years ago is still relevant today
- When tempted to ship early, ask: "Will I be proud of this in 3 years?"
- Block 3-month periods for single projects with zero other commitments
- Build speed projects to fund depth projects

### Big Idea
The internet confuses activity with progress—everyone is sprinting toward mediocrity because they're terrified of the silence that comes with depth. But depth creates permanence, and permanence creates legacy. Speed gets you attention. Depth gets you remembered.

### Memorable Closing Insight
The fastest way to create something timeless is to move slowly enough to get it right.
