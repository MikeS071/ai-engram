# Post Outline: Being Early Versus Being Right

## POST OUTLINE 19:

### Core Paradox
Being early and being wrong look identical for years. Being right on time means you missed the opportunity. The biggest wins come from being early and having the conviction to outlast everyone who calls you wrong.

Early looks like failure. Right on time looks like following.

The distance between visionary and delusional is measured in years, not arguments.

### Key Quotes
- "The state of Computer Vision and AI: we are really, really far away" - Karpathy's early skepticism
- "Everything, Everywhere, All AI" - BVP seeing the shift early
- "The future of AI is vertical" - Early bet on specific applications
- Ben Thompson's early analysis of aggregation theory before it was obvious
- Dan Koe on one-person businesses before the creator economy exploded
- "Machine learning is going real-time" - Chip Huyen calling the shift

### Transformation Arc
From waiting for proof before committing → watching early adopters succeed massively → realizing the biggest returns come from being early, not right on time → developing conviction to be early despite looking wrong → learning to distinguish between early and actually wrong

### Core Problems
- You wait for confirmation and miss the opportunity by the time it's obvious
- You were early once, got burned, and now you're too cautious
- You can't tell if you're early or just wrong, so you stay paralyzed

### Key Examples
- Ben Thompson betting on independent tech analysis before Substack made it obvious
- Chip Huyen focusing on MLOps and production ML before it became the standard
- Dan Koe building one-person business frameworks before the creator economy matured

### Reader Objections
- "But how do I know if I'm early or just wrong? They look the same"
- "Being early means years of struggle for uncertain payoff—that's not smart"
- "The early adopters who failed never tell their stories—survivorship bias"

### Aspirational Statement
To capture the biggest opportunities, you must develop the judgment to spot what's early versus what's wrong, the conviction to commit before others see it, and the resilience to outlast the years when being early looks identical to being delusional.

### Actionable Steps
- Identify where experts disagree—that's where early opportunities hide
- Make public predictions about the future and track your accuracy
- When something feels inevitable but isn't mainstream, that's your signal
- Be early in areas where you have unique insight, not random bets
- Give your early bets 3-5 years before judging success or failure
- Study what early looks like: lonely, uncertain, mocked by consensus
- Build conviction through research, not consensus validation

### Big Idea
Being early and being wrong are indistinguishable for years. The people who capture massive opportunities are those with the conviction to be early, the patience to outlast skepticism, and the judgment to distinguish between contrarian-and-right versus contrarian-and-wrong. Right on time is too late.

### Memorable Closing Insight
Being early looks like being wrong until suddenly it looks like being brilliant. The distance is measured in time and conviction, not evidence.
