# Post Outline: Open Source Versus Product

## POST OUTLINE 6:

### Core Paradox
Open source makes you known. Products make you wealthy. You need both, but most people trap themselves in one, mistaking visibility for value or revenue for impact.

Give everything away. Charge for everything. Both are wrong. Both are right.

The best businesses are built on open foundations. The best open source is funded by business.

### Key Quotes
- "What I learned from looking at 900 most popular open source AI tools" - Chip Huyen on the ecosystem
- Simon Willison building Datasette open source while monetizing consulting and tools
- "Measuring the engagement of an open source software community" - BVP on metrics
- "How developer platforms scale with product-led growth strategies"
- Eugene Yan sharing applied ML insights freely while working at Amazon
- Sebastian Ruder publishing research while building commercial AI at Cohere

### Transformation Arc
From believing open source and business are opposites → building one while neglecting the other → hitting a ceiling of impact or income → discovering the few who integrate both seamlessly → learning to give away knowledge while capturing value through application

### Core Problems
- You built amazing open source but can't pay rent with GitHub stars
- You built a profitable product in private and no one knows you exist
- You're torn between giving value away and building a business

### Key Examples
- Simon Willison: Co-created Django (open source), built Datasette (open), monetizes through tools and expertise
- Andrej Karpathy: Shares education freely, works on cutting-edge commercial AI
- Chip Huyen: Writes comprehensive free guides, builds production AI platforms commercially

### Reader Objections
- "But if I open source it, someone will just copy it and beat me"
- "How can I make money if I'm giving everything away for free?"
- "Open source is for people who already have money or fame"

### Aspirational Statement
To maximize both impact and income, you must develop the strategic thinking to know what to open source and what to keep proprietary, the generosity to share knowledge while capturing value through execution, and the clarity to build in public while profiting in private.

### Actionable Steps
- Open source your tools and frameworks, monetize your application and execution
- Share your knowledge freely, charge for your time and expertise
- Build your reputation through open contributions, your wealth through private projects
- Use open source to prove your capabilities, products to capture the value
- Give away the "what" and "why," sell the "how" and "done for you"
- Study companies built on open foundations with commercial layers
- Choose: open source to build distribution, then monetize the next layer

### Big Idea
Open source and products aren't opposing strategies—they're complementary forces. Open source builds trust, distribution, and reputation. Products capture value, create sustainability, and fund more open source. The best builders do both deliberately, not accidentally.

### Memorable Closing Insight
Give away the map. Sell the journey. Keep exploring.
