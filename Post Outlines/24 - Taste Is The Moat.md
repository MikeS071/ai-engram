# Post Outline: Taste Is The Moat

## POST OUTLINE 24:

### Core Paradox
AI can now write, design, code, and compose. Every technical skill is being commodified at scale. But taste — knowing what to build, what to cut, what to ship, and what to kill — is getting more valuable by the hour. The era of infinite production makes curation the ultimate skill.

Execution is cheap and scales infinitely. Taste doesn't.

In a world where anyone can build anything, the only advantage is knowing what's worth building.

### Key Quotes
- "Be a paradox. Build one thing, but don't be one thing"
- "Be an artist and a capitalist"
- "You give the world something new, by becoming something new"
- "Chaos and simplicity. Genius and madness"
- "It's a line, between two opposites, that most never touch"

### Transformation Arc
From obsessing over technical skills and output volume → realizing that the most impactful people aren't the most skilled, they're the most discerning → watching AI make execution cheap and infinitely scalable, flattening the gap between amateurs and professionals → understanding that taste — the ability to recognize what's good, what's missing, and what's unnecessary — is the last human moat → choosing to develop taste through wide exposure and ruthless editing rather than chasing more output

### Core Problems
- You can build anything but you don't know what's worth building
- You ship more and more but nothing resonates because your filter is broken
- You've confused productivity with quality and volume with impact

### Key Examples
- Steve Jobs having no engineering skill but the taste to know exactly what to remove from a product
- Music producers who can't play instruments but hear the hit before anyone else
- The best editors — in writing, film, code — who create by subtracting, not adding

### Reader Objections
- "Taste is subjective — how do you even develop something that can't be measured?"
- "Isn't technical skill still the foundation? Taste without skill is just opinions"
- "AI can already curate and recommend — won't taste get commodified too?"

### Aspirational Statement
To thrive in the age of infinite production, you must develop an unfair sense of taste — the eye to see what others miss, the courage to cut what others keep, and the judgment to know when something is done before the world tells you it's not enough.

### Actionable Steps
- Study the best work in your field obsessively — not to copy, but to calibrate your filter
- Practice removing, not adding — edit your work until it hurts, then edit again
- Consume widely across disciplines: art, music, architecture, film, food — taste is cross-domain
- Develop strong opinions about what's good and defend them, even when unpopular
- Build the habit of asking "what would I cut?" before "what would I add?"
- Surround yourself with people who have better taste than you — absorption is faster than instruction
- Ship less, but make everything you ship undeniable
- Let AI handle the cheap, scalable execution — you handle the direction

### Big Idea
The world doesn't need more creators. It needs better curators. As AI makes execution cheap and infinitely scalable, the ability to discern what's excellent from what's mediocre becomes the ultimate competitive advantage. Taste isn't a soft skill. It's the hardest skill. And it's the only one that gets more valuable as machines get smarter.

### Memorable Closing Insight
In five years, everyone will be able to build anything. The only question that matters is: do you know what's worth building? Taste is the last moat. Sharpen it or drown in noise.
