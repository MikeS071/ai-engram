# Post Outline: Start Before You're Ready

## POST OUTLINE 12:

### Core Paradox
Everyone waits until they're "ready" to start. But readiness is earned through starting, not achieved before it. The people who wait for readiness stay waiting forever.

You'll never feel ready. That's the point. That's the test.

Preparation is procrastination dressed in productive clothing.

### Key Quotes
- "7 reasons not to join a startup and 1 reason to" - Chip Huyen on leaping before ready
- "Career advice for recent Computer Science graduates" - Starting imperfectly
- Dan Koe building in public before having credentials or permission
- "Confession of a so-called AI expert" - Andrej Karpathy on imposter syndrome
- Simon Willison's "daily explorations" - shipping experiments constantly
- "A Survival Guide to a PhD" - Andrej Karpathy on starting unclear

### Transformation Arc
From believing you need more preparation before starting → watching others succeed while you study → realizing they started messy and figured it out → understanding that clarity comes from action, not contemplation → choosing to start scared and get ready on the way

### Core Problems
- You're waiting to start until you've learned enough, but "enough" never arrives
- You watch less-qualified people succeed because they started while you prepared
- You're paralyzed by the gap between where you are and where you want to be

### Key Examples
- Andrej Karpathy starting his blog not as an expert but as someone learning publicly
- Dan Koe building his one-person business before having all the answers
- Simon Willison experimenting with AI tools daily, publishing experiments as he learns

### Reader Objections
- "But won't starting before I'm ready just expose my incompetence?"
- "Don't I need credentials, skills, and experience before anyone will listen?"
- "Isn't this just encouraging people to ship garbage?"

### Aspirational Statement
To actually achieve what you're capable of, you must develop the courage to start before you feel ready, the resilience to learn publicly while making mistakes, and the clarity to understand that readiness is a destination you reach by walking, not a ticket you buy before the journey.

### Actionable Steps
- Set a deadline to start that's uncomfortably soon—this week, not next month
- Commit publicly to your project before you know how you'll complete it
- Ship a terrible first version and improve it publicly
- Replace "I need to learn X first" with "I'll learn X while building Y"
- Study people who started messy and iterated their way to mastery
- When you feel 50% ready, start immediately—you'll never feel 100% ready
- Document your journey from the beginning, especially the uncertain parts

### Big Idea
Readiness is a myth sold by people who never start. The people you admire didn't wait to feel ready—they started scared, learned through failure, and got ready on the way. Every day you spend preparing is a day you could be learning through real action.

### Memorable Closing Insight
You'll never feel ready. Start anyway. Ready is something you become by doing.
